# Peer Review with GitHub

In this group, you are going to use GitHub to provide peer review and editing for an article manuscript. The article manuscript is currently in the review phase for publication in [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*](https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/). This project describes itself as:
>a curated collection of reusable and remixable pedagogical artifacts for humanities scholars in development by the Modern Language Association." 

Kim Middelton's article "Remix" is an apt choice for this demonstration, both in terms of its content and its current phase of production. Still in draft form, Kim's article is awaiting peer review.  We will put the article into peer review and provide line-by-line feedback.  Feel free to provide commentary, substantive suggestions for the text, or copy-editing notes.  

As you are working through this demonstration, please keep the instructions open in either a second window or next to you as a printout.

## Instructions

1. Open the Keywords folder (above if you are viewing this in a browser) and click on the file labeled remix.md  
2. Click on the edit button (a pencil in the gray menu bar) at the top of the screen

3. In the section entitled Publication Status, change the publication status to undergoing review by changing which option is **bold**
4. Add a couple of notes in the file suggesting changes. To do this add a paragraph wherever you want to make a suggestion using the format Yourname: your suggested revisions.
